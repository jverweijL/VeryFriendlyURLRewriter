# Friendly URL for Web Content Item

Sometimes you want to change the friendly URL for a web content item.
With this module it will automatically use the folder-structure where you place the web content item and adjust the friendly url.

This could also work with e.g. categories which I might add later if you need it.

With the friendly url you can have paths like:
```
http://localhost:8080/web/guest/-/sports/football/barcelona
```

With nginx (or any other reverse proxy) you can probably make them even more friendly ;-)
